# Need a python or Java or C# program that scraps Amazon and outputs results to Google Doc.
# It need to do the following:
# Select 5 Products
# Based on key phrases provided
# Number of Reviews
# Average Rating
# (Essentially getting the best products for the keyphrase)
# Output: Name, Amazon URL,
# How it would work:
# I enter a key phrase
# Program scraps Amazon using that phrase.
# It finds the products with the most reviews
# It then picks the 5 that have the best average rating
# Produces results with product name & Amazon URL
# Additional information: Output to Google Doc.
# Process: Duplicate existing template, Replace Product 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 with Scrapped data.
